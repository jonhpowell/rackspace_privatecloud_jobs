support our organizational vision: To become the preferred brand for consuming
complex open source infrastructure, as-a-Service, delivering industry-leading
simplicity, efficiency, and reliability.

Our team supports this mission by improving
[observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) (i.e. insight
into) and [controllability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllability)
(i.e. state mutation) of cloud deployments located in datacenters throughout
the world.

- **Team Size**: Currently 8 senior developers/engineers and a technical manager
- **Hours**: We have flexible working hours and aim for a median of 35-40 hours a week
- **Location**: US/UK work from home with offices in US/UK (most states supported)
- **Travel**: About once or twice a year for a conference or team gathering

### Responsibilities

- Help develop and maintain *observability*/controllability of customer environments
- Help drive zero downtime (0DD) CI/CD for our team's infrastructure and app stack
- Work directly with support engineers, operations, product management, and end-users
- Develop automation to improve efficiency, reliability, and simplicity of clouds
- Take high level problems and autonomously deliver solutions supported by data
- Develop solutions that leverage and integrate existing open source technologies
- Engage asynchronously with team members via Slack, Jira, github, and email
- Engage synchronously with team members via video calls

### Qualifications

The ideal candidate will have the following (**not** hard requirements):

- Experience defining and operating production systems that run at scale
- Experience developing and deploying applications at scale
- Experience working on distributed teams
